# Straya

Straya is a fitness website for tracking your workouts and building custom training routes. It is inspired by Strava. It uses a Rails/PostgreSQL backend with a React.js and Redux frontend.

The project was designed and built over a 1 week timeframe, with additional improvements to be added over time.
